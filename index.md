# SeBiMER 

SeBiMER is the Bioinformatics Core Facility of [IFREMER](https://wwz.ifremer.fr/en/), the French National Institute for Ocean Science. 

SeBiMER is in charge of providing a large community of marine biologists with all the requirements (knowledge, softwares and data) to handle small and large scale bioinformatics projects, mostly in the fields of metabarcoding (eDNA), (meta-)transcriptomics and genomes assembly & annotaton.

SeBiMER manages two Galaxy portals and more than 380 softwares, all of them being deployed and configured on [DATARMOR](https://www.top500.org/site/50682), Ifremer's supercomputer. The Core Facility is also in charge of managing sequencing data on behalf of biologists: data is organized using EDAM ontology, stored on high-performance and secured disk storage and made accessible to 11,000 cores of DATARMOR.

SeBiMER team is made of 5 permanent engineers and PhDs with extensive skills in biology, bioinformatics, computer science, software development, data analysis.

# SeBiMER missions

SeBiMER activity targets 4 main poles : IT managment (e.g. sequencing data and software installation & configuration on DATARMOR); Bioanalysis (e.g. extensive data analysis in close relation with research teams); Software Development (e.g. design of new tools and data analysis workflows; see below); Bioinformatics R&D.
