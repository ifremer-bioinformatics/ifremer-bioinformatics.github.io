# SeBiMER 

SeBiMER is the Bioinformatics Core Facility of [IFREMER](https://en.ifremer.fr/), the French National Institute for Ocean Science. 

SeBiMER is in charge of providing a large community of marine biologists with all the requirements (knowledge, softwares and data) to handle small and large scale bioinformatics projects, mostly in the fields of metabarcoding (eDNA), (meta-)transcriptomics and genomes assembly & annotation.

SeBiMER manages two Galaxy portals and more than 500 softwares covering 28 EDAM Operation topics, all of them being deployed and configured on [DATARMOR](https://www.top500.org/site/50682), Ifremer's supercomputer. SeBiMER is also in charge of [managing sequencing data](https://sextant.ifremer.fr/Donnees/Catalogue#/search?fast=index&_content_type=json&from=1&to=30&sortBy=changeDate&sextantTheme=http:%2F%2Fwww.ifremer.fr%2Fthesaurus%2Fsextant%2Ftheme%239b5b4f5f-327a-4487-9ee8-ef204c0a0016) in a FAIR way on behalf of biologists: data is organized using EDAM ontology, stored on high-performance and secured disk storage and made accessible to 11,000 cores of DATARMOR.

SeBiMER team is made of 5 permanent engineers and PhDs with extensive skills in biology, bioinformatics, computer science, software development, data analysis.

# SeBiMER missions

SeBiMER activity targets 5 main missions : 
* IT managment (e.g. sequencing data and software installation & configuration on DATARMOR); 
* Bioanalysis (e.g. extensive data analysis in close relation with research teams); 
* Software Development (e.g. design of new tools and data analysis workflows; see below); 
* Bioinformatics R&D
* trainings
